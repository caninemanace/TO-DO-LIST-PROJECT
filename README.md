<h1>PROJECT NAME :TO-DO-LIST</h1> <br>
PROJECT DESCRIPTION : A TO-DO-LIST made from the knowledge I aquired from Moringa foundations for software development and the full-stack software development program.Currently has a lot of room for more improvements majorly on the aspect that it should be able to mark tasks as done and save the tasks to local storoge.I'd also like to take a step further and try enable the site to be able to conevert between dark and light mode.
Other than that this project has helped me understand DOM manupulation using javascript and a deeeper understanding on the concept of event listeners. <br> <hr>
